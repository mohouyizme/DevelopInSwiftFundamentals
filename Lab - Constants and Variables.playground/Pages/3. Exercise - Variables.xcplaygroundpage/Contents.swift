 ## Exercise - Variables
 
 Declare a variable `schooling` and set it to the number of years of school that you have completed. Print `schooling` to the console.
 */
var schooling = 14

/*:
 Now imagine you just completed an additional year of school, and update the `schooling` variable accordingly. Print `schooling` to the console.
 */
schooling = schooling + 1
print(schooling)
/*:
 Does the above code compile? Why is this different than trying to update a constant? Print your explanation to the console using the `print` function.
 */
print("Yes the code above compiles. We use variables for values that can be changed, while we use constants for static values that we won't change or we don't want them to change, that's why we can't update a constant value.")
